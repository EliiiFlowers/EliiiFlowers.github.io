  I am Elizabeth Moreno Flores, a graduate in Biomedical Engineering from the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico. My goal is to develop myself as a Data Analyst. My previous experience is focused on the biomedical field, where I have worked in multidisciplinary teams in public hospitals and the PPS scheme. I possess skills in data cleaning, data visualization, dashboard creation, using tools such as Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python, and R. I am constantly learning and expanding my proficiency in these tools to enhance my capabilities as a Data Analyst.
